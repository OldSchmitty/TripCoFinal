**Name: Mark Smith**

**Personality: ENFP**

1. Text and Email between 8:30 AM-10:00 PM
2. The only expectation I have is that we do our best.
3. I hope to be able to use teamwork technology platforms better (GitHub etc.) as well as be less dominate over projects.
4. I can sometimes take too much of a project on to myself or have to low of expectations from others.
5. As with any conflict a compromise must be reached. The important thing is that the goal of each team member is communicated. I would normally just pick up the extra slack to get the A.
6. Yes, but it is not fair nor right. Its life and sometimes you have to accept that if you want the A, you have to do more work than the others in your team.
7. It’s hard to say because each individual will work at different paces and I don’t know what the task is. I would just give a minimum of 9 hours a week, the recommended time of 3 hours outside of class for every 1 hour spent in it.
8. Get together and discuss strengths and weaknesses, and then distribute workload based on that information. People usually gravitate towards what they feel confident doing. Otherwise you could do a rotation of work duties to ensure fairness. What is most important is that the team is in agreeance on the workload.
9. First, Ill attempt to do it myself, then communicate with the team member about what happened, how to avoid it in the future, their workload, etc.
10. I typically side with the worst opinion, or assume the quality is bad. Always better to exceed expectations than to not meet them.
11. Adapt and try to work in a way that enables them. I am very flexible in my approach.
12. Yes, but I don’t have to have one.
13. At least once a week.
14. For my own decisions yes, unless it is something basic.
15. Find a compromise. I strongly believe one can always be found.
16. This will probably be me, so I will step back and make sure the team is on the same page. In the rare occasion it is someone else I will try to find a way to help enable their goals while not being left out of the process.
17. Communicate with the team about how I feel and get a consensus on how to redistribute the workload if needed. Sometimes I just accept the responsibility and get the project done.
