**Name:** awdennis
**Personality Type:** ESTP

**Questionnaire:**
1.	Text or phone call. 6am-9pm.
2.	I expect that we will get the majority of the points on most assignments. Average an A on assignment grades. I have very high expectations of myself and any work I submit.
3.	I have a very assertive personality and like to set goals to get things done ahead of schedule. I typically like my work to be as close to perfect and polished as I can possibly get it and will put in a lot of extra time to fix even the minutest details. My goal for the semester is to communicate openly and effectively and try not to dominate the workload or be too picky about the work we submit.
4.	Disagreements on what is acceptable work to turn in. 
5.	A team meeting is held to determine what the majority wants out of the assignment and we go from there. Hopefully a compromise can be met otherwise an imbalance of work may occur.
6.	An imbalance of work will be reflected in the team evaluations. Everyone should be on par with what is expected of them to achieve the group’s goals. If some members are forced to pick up the slack of others they should not receive the same grade.
7.	6-10 hours per person per week. 
8.	Hold a group meeting the first week of each assignment to coordinate a plan of attack and split responsibilities as needed. Hold at least 1 but preferably 2 meetings a week to make sure we are all making progress and still on the same page.
9.	The group we hold a meeting to discuss it with that member. If it is a reoccurring problem we will schedule a meeting with the professor and reflect the problem in team evaluations.
10.	A compromise must be made. Perhaps certain areas can be deemed sufficient while others need more work. Communication of expectations is crucial.
11.	As long as deadlines are met everyone is free to work at their own time and pace. During weekly meetings a selected team member should guide the discussion. This can rotate or be fixed depending on the needs of the group.
12.	Yes, I would like to set up at least 2 meetings per week to ensure we keep progress.
13.	1-3 times per week depending on the project.
14.	On major things like overall design that will affect how the pieces of code fit together yes. On smaller details like implementation of the design plan no, each individual can make those decisions as long as it is testable and works with the design. It would be nice to agree on a coding “style” that all members stick to in order to keep things readable between different members code.
15.	Try to convince them of the rationale behind our decision. Not everyone will agree 100 percent of the time. That’s fine. Sometimes you just have to go with the majority decision otherwise nothing will ever get done.
16.	I think some people take a leadership role which can be good to provide direction to the group as long as they listen and actively include all members of the group. Sometimes a leadership presence can help focus ideas and give a direction to group activities.
17.	I’m fine with that. I don’t mind organizing a plan to help focus the group.
