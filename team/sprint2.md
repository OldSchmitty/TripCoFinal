# Sprint 2 - *T15* - *WolfPack*

## Goal

### A shorter trip with a better itinerary.

## Definition of Done

* Ready for the demo.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed.
* Product Increment release created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the template, and a JAR file containing the executables to be used for the demo. 
* Unit tests for all new features and public methods at a minimum.
* Clean continuous integration build/test on master branch.
* No outstanding branches, commits, pull requests.

## Policies

* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Continuous integration always builds and tests successfully.
* Tests are written before/with code.  
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All pull requests include tests for the affected code.

## Plan 

User stories (epics) in the Sprint Backlog: #91, #93, #97. #99, #101

## Review

#### Completed user stories (epics) in Sprint Backlog 
#91, #97. #101

#### Incomplete user stories / epics in Sprint Backlog 
#93, #99

#### What went well
Shortest path, svg files, and everything in Java. 

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
We have a very poor understanding of JavaScript, specifically with react. We started to try and learn javascript as a team.
We also had minor bugs, but were easily fixed through teamwork.

## Retrospective

Topic | Teamwork | Process | Tools
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
What we will change this time | We set up a Discord channel to be able to communicate whenever we can reach a computer. | More effective use of issues on github. Ex: Not making an issue for each method, but instead an issue for each problem or request. | Every group member is creating a linux environment.
What we did well | We have very productive meetings, and good planning | We use zenhub well and Master never broke  | Mastered intellij, and every group member has a linux environment
What we need to work on | Communicating changes in design implementations| We need to be better at dealing with merge conflicts, use our .gitignore better. | We need to learn react, get a better IDE for javascript
What we will change next time | Use discord more for communication. Be more proactive in scrum meetings | Organize our directories and edit our .gitignore | learn react by end of next sprint for all team members
