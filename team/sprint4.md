# Sprint 4 - T15 - Wolf Pack
## Goal

### Worldwide trips!

## Definition of Done

* Ready for the demo.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed.
* Product Increment release `v4.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the template, and an executable JAR file for the demo.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>4.0.0</version>`.
* Unit tests for all new features and public methods at a minimum.
* Coverage at least 50% overall and for each class.
* Clean continuous integration build/test on master branch.

## Policies

* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration always builds and tests successfully.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

## Review

#### Completed user stories (epics) in Sprint Backlog 
* #261 #262 #263 #264 #284

Completed *number of issues completed* issues associated with these user stories.
* 38

#### Incomplete user stories / epics in Sprint Backlog 
* None

#### What went well
* Less Javascript problems than normal, website transition, Teamwork!

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* app.js is too cumbersome to run and debug probably, we are wanting to break this up into multiple classes, 3-Opt took a lot longer than estimated to complete, numerous bugs found couple days before demo that were found and fixed

## Retrospective

Topic | Teamwork | Process | Tools
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
What we will change this time |If stuck for an hour, ask a question on discord | Try full scrum | Make local database for SQL access
What we did well | Collaboration amongst each other while coding | The initial plan was followed almost entirely | Accomplished changes that we had wanted to make things easier 
What we need to work on | Still need a better way to commuinicate | Limit number of issues per pull - ONLY 1 | React callback functions 
What we will change next time | Actively find a better way to communicate - possibly Slack | Using code climate better - don't push unless it looks pretty good, Stop putting up pull requests with multiple issues | Switch to Slack for Communication and possibly meeting in CS120 Lab for work
