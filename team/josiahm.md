**Questionnaire**
1.	Is it generally easier to reach you by text, email, vmail or something else?  What hours?
Email is the best way to reach me but texts also work. Except for the times I am in classes (8am – 12pm MWF and 8am – 2pm TR), I usually have some time to respond to messages.
2.	What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
Learn how to use GitHub for a group project, learn how to properly review other people’s code, and learn how work on a project and not handle all the work that needs to be done. Also, learn how to make a product that could actual be shipped.
3.	What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?
I would like to be able to contribute to the project without either trying to be the main leader or just being subservient to the group. 
4.	What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?
Conflicts on how to accomplish the projects and who will work in what parts.
5.	What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?
Since I would like an A, I would probably work more on the project to improve it.
6.	Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?
Yes, see question above.
7.	How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?
8-10 for the first two weeks and probably more on the last week.
8.	How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
If someone has more experience in a particular aspect of the project, they should take the lead in that part and help others understand what needs to be done.
9.	What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?
At first, adjust the work load to compensate, and if it continues, bring the issue to the professor.
10.	What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?
I do not know, I have never been in that situation.
11.	How will you deal with different work habits of team members?
I usually adjust my work schedule to account for their actions, and I would push for more deadlines so procrastinators still deliver their work before the deadlines.
12.	Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
Yes
13.	How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
Once at the beginning of each week to discuss what has been done and what still needs to be done.
14.	Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?
Not for small decisions, but for major design choices, we should have an agreement from the group.\
15.	What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?
If they provide a convincing argument for their decision, we should examine the two ideas but a choice still needs to be made.
16.	What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?
If I think their actions are an improvement to the project, I will accept them and step of the quality of my work.
17.	What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?
Do them.
